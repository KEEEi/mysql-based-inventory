# mysql based inventory system
The object of this project is to build a set of web pages that interface with a MySQL database and utilizes transactions where
necessary.

## Problem Statement 
The web pages will:
- connect to and use a specified database.
- create underlying table(s) as needed.
- allow addition of recipes/ingredients for those recipes.
- display ingredients needed for a recipe when given a recipe name.
- allow purchase of ingredients required for a recipe from the store.
- add more ingredients into the inventory of the store, noting that such may actually just be
  an increase in existing inventory for an ingredient.

In order to do this, you will first need to get the user of the web based application to specify their username and password as well as the IP address of the MySQL database server. And for this project, start page prompt for their database credentials and then store such in a session.

## Usage
For executing this programs, please use XAMP or FTP tools in your local environment.
